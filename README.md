## Software Methodology Considerations
#### Methodologies considered
1. Agile
2. Waterfall
3. Spiral 
4. Iterative

## What we understand from these methodologies?

#### Agile

Agile methodology is based on collaborative decision making between requirements and solutions teams, and a cyclical, iterative progression of producing working software. Work is done in regularly iterated cycles, known as sprints, that usually last two to four weeks. Continuous collaboration is key, both among team members and with project stakeholders, to make fully-informed decisions.It is best used when the full scope of requirements are not known.

#### Waterfall

The waterfall model emphasizes that a logical progression of steps be taken throughout the software development life cycle (SDLC), much like the cascading steps down an incremental waterfall. In "The Waterfall" approach, the whole process of software development is divided into separate phases. In this Waterfall model, typically, the outcome of one phase acts as the input for the next phase sequentially.

#### Spiral

The Spiral Model has 4 phases which are identification, design, construct & build and evaluation and risk analysis. The model combines the idea of iterative development with the systematic, controlled aspects of waterfall method. So, it is similar to the waterfall model but with a higher emphasis on the risk analysis. This model also allows incremental releases/refining of the product following each iteration around the spiral.

#### Iterative

## What are the pros and cons of these methodologies?
#### Agile

- Pros
  - Not as dependant on paperwork
  - Offers more opportunities for experimentation
  - Can adapt to change better and faster
  - More stakeholder engagement
- Cons

#### Waterfall

- Pros
  - Project requirements are agreed upon in the first phase, so planning and scheduling is simple and clear.
  - With a fully laid out project schedule, you can give accurate estimates for your project cost, resources and deadlines.
  - It’s easy to measure progress as you move through the phases and hit milestones.
  - Customers aren’t perpetually adding new requirements to the project, which can delay production.  
- Cons        
  - It can be difficult for customers to articulate all of their needs at the beginning of the project.
  - If the customer is dissatisfied with the product in the verification phase, it can be very costly to go back and design the code again.
  - A linear project plan is rigid, and lacks flexibility for adapting to unexpected events.
  
#### Spiral

- Pros
  - The constantly changing requirements can be accommodated.
  - Allows extensive use of prototypes.
  - Requirements can be captured more accurately.
  - Development can be divided into smaller parts and the risky parts can be developed earlier which helps in better risk management.
- Cons
  - Management is more complex
  - The end of the project is not determined
  - Not suitable for small or low risk projects and could be expensive for small projects.
  - Large numbers of intermediate stages require excessive documentation.

#### Iterative
- Pros
- Cons
